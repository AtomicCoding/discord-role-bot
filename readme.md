## Assigning roles since 2019

### Purpose
This is a JSON configurable bot written in discord.py, that seeks to
automate many role-based inconveniences, it asks questions and assigns
roles based off that, it has a role database that will assign roles,
and even an anonymous complaints system.

### How do I use it?
It's uses discord.py version 0.16.12, and works like any other python 
script, so feel free to run it on Heroku, or on your own home server.
#### What about the JSON?
There are instructions on how to use the JSON in the data.json file
that is in the repository, so feel free to modify the example code,
and read the comments inside to get a understanding of how it works.
If you still need help, feel free to open an issue.
