automate many role-based inconveniences, it asks questions and assigns
roles based off that, it has a role database that will assign roles,
and even an anonymous complaints system.

It's uses the latest version of discord.py, and works like any other python 
script, so feel free to run it on any cloud platform, or on your own home server.
#### What about the JSON?
There are instructions on how to use the JSON in the example.json file
that is in the repository, so feel free to modify the example data,
and read the comments inside to get a understanding of how it works.
