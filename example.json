        // A. Create private channels that people can get assigned to based on their intrests
        // B. Create some sort of role that people can @ to ask them questions about the topic their role is setup for
        // C. Create seperated areas on the member list, based off of peoples opinions and intrests
        // But thats just some ideas, theres plenty of other things you can do
